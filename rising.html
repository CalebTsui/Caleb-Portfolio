                    <p>The five-week academic project was centred around streamlining the flow of the booking process of 88Rising artists for third-party booking agents. This all culminated in a microsite (desktop and mobile), which illustrated the team’s proposed solutions and insightful user experience choice. *This project is not affiliated with 88Rising. It is a case study done for an academic project.*</p>

                    <p>With the freedom to pick any existing clients, our team chose 88Rising as our client after filtering all potential options. 88rising is an American music label founded in 2015. Formerly known as CSXHXNLY, the label primarily houses Asian-American musical talents such as Joji, Rich Brian, and Higher Brothers.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The musical booking agent role is incredibly challenging. It involves significant effort, time, organization and interaction. A normal day involves cold-calling artists, calling several venues to discuss scheduling for artists, and financial negotiations between multiple parties. While 88Rising does not have a clear booking procedure. The website’s primary focus is to streamline the booking process, using our microsite acting as the middle-man.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>To explore potential art directions for the microsite, our team engaged in experimentation with two distinct mood boards. This approach allowed us to study diverse design decisions from other projects and create designs that align with the identified attributes.</p>

                    <p>Utilizing Webflow, a teammate and I translated the design into a website, with my primary focus on the home, about, and booking pages. Despite the constraints of Webflow, which prevented a perfect replication of the Figma design, I dedicated efforts to troubleshooting any arising issues during the process. The aim was to demonstrate the prototype as closely as possible to the original design. In the end, our microsite and design process received high praise from the teaching team for its quality.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Given that none of the group members had prior experience with Webflow and it was not covered in class, my fellow website builder and I had to quickly learn the application within a week. Additionally, as we were working with the free version of Webflow, we encountered constraints such as limitations on the number of pages we could create and the implementation of advanced features using HTML/CSS.</p>
                    
                    <p>Consequently, we had to make strategic decisions to prioritize and refine our ideas in order to effectively showcase our solutions within these limitations. If I could go back, I would try a different platform, such as Figma, to create the mockup microsite for a more satisfying result.</p>
